        <p>Hello! Thank you for visiting my very first self-made website. My name is Ronja and I am currently taking an Udemy online course called <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/">The Complete 2022 Web
            Development Bootcamp</a> from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/angela-yu-963a584b/">Dr. Angela Yu.</a></p>
        <p>The reason why I started learning to code in March 2022 is documented <a href="https://codepen.io/ronjala/pen/WNdpgZm">here</a>.
          I created this website when I took a <a href="https://www.technigo.io/free-coding-workshop">Free, Two-Hour Creative Coding Workshop for Beginners</a> with <a href="https://www.technigo.io/">Technigo</a>.
          After taking the workshop, I was really inspired and wanted to learn more. I spent a lot of time researching different ways to learn programming. I was suprised to find out that there are tons of online resources for free for people to
          learn to code.
          The programming community is really open and everyone who I have talked to about the subject has been encouranging.
          The more I research, the more I like programming and the community of it.
          Since my contract from my latest employment has come to an end, I decided to dedicate 2 hours a day to learn programming for 100 days, starting on 22nd of April, 2022.
          By first of August 2022, I will complete my 100 days of coding challenge. I am excited to learn more!</p>
        <p>I am documenting my 100 days of coding challenge on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ronjaelisabe/">my Instagram account</a>. Feel free to follow me and cheer me up üòâ</p>
